Preface

No programming technique solves all problems. No programming language produces only correct results. No programmer should start each project from scratch.
Object-oriented programming is the current cure-all — although it has been around for much more then ten years. At the core, there is little more to it then finally applying the good programming principles which we have been taught for more then twenty years. C++ (Eiffel, Oberon-2, Smalltalk ... take your pick) is the New Language because it is object-oriented — although you need not use it that way if you do not want to (or know how to), and it turns out that you can do just as well with plain ANSI-C. Only object-orientation permits code reuse between pro- jects — although the idea of subroutines is as old as computers and good program- mers always carried their toolkits and libraries with them.
This book is not going to praise object-oriented programming or condemn the Old Way. We are simply going to use ANSI-C to discover how object-oriented pro- gramming is done, what its techniques are, why they help us solve bigger prob- lems, and how we harness generality and program to catch mistakes earlier. Along the way we encounter all the jargon — classes, inheritance, instances, linkage, methods, objects, polymorphisms, and more — but we take it out of the realm of magic and see how it translates into the things we have known and done all along.
I had fun discovering that ANSI-C is a full-scale object-oriented language. To share this fun you need to be reasonably fluent in ANSI-C to begin with — feeling comfortable with structures, pointers, prototypes, and function pointers is a must. Working through the book you will encounter all the newspeak — according to Orwell and Webster a language ‘‘designed to diminish the range of thought’’ — and I will try to demonstrate how it merely combines all the good programming princi- ples that you always wanted to employ into a coherent approach. As a result, you may well become a more proficient ANSI-C programmer.
The first six chapters develop the foundations of object-oriented programming with ANSI-C. We start with a careful information hiding technique for abstract data types, add generic functions based on dynamic linkage and inherit code by judicious lengthening of structures. Finally, we put it all together in a class hierarchy that makes code much easier to maintain.
Programming takes discipline. Good programming takes a lot of discipline, a large number of principles, and standard, defensive ways of doing things right. Pro- grammers use tools. Good programmers make tools to dispose of routine tasks once and for all. Object-oriented programming with ANSI-C requires a fair amount of immutable code — names may change but not the structures. Therefore, in chapter seven we build a small preprocessor to create the boilerplate required. It looks like yet another new object-oriented dialect language (yanoodl perhaps?) but it should not be viewed as such — it gets the dull parts out of the way and lets us concentrate on the creative aspects of problem solving with better techniques. ooc

vi	Preface

(sorry) is pliable: we have made it, we understand it and can change it, and it writes the ANSI-C code just like we would.
The following chapters refine our technology. In chapter eight we add dynamic type checking to catch our mistakes earlier on. In chapter nine we arrange for automatic initialization to prevent another class of bugs. Chapter ten introduces delegates and shows how classes and callback functions cooperate to simplify, for example, the constant chore of producing standard main programs. More chapters are concerned with plugging memory leaks by using class methods, storing and loading structured data with a coherent strategy, and disciplined error recovery through a system of nested exception handlers.
Finally, in the last chapter we leave the confines of ANSI-C and implement the obligatory mouse-operated calculator, first for curses and then for the X Window System. This example neatly demonstrates how elegantly we can design and implement using objects and classes, even if we have to cope with the idiosyn- crasies of foreign libraries and class hierarchies.
Each chapter has a summary where I try to give the more cursory reader a run- down on the happenings in the chapter and their importance for future work. Most chapters suggest some exercises; however, they are not spelled out formally, because I firmly believe that one should experiment on one’s own. Because we are building the techniques from scratch, I have refrained from making and using a massive class library, even though some examples could have benefited from it. If you want to understand object-oriented programming, it is more important to first master the techniques and consider your options in code design; dependence on somebody else’s library for your developments should come a bit later.
An important part of this book is the enclosed source floppy — it has a DOS file system containing a single shell script to create all the sources arranged by chapter. There is a ReadMe file — consult it before you say make. It is also quite instructive to use a program like diff and trace the evolution of the root classes and ooc reports through the later chapters.
The techniques described here grew out of my disenchantment with C++ when I needed object-oriented techniques to implement an interactive programming language and realized that I could not forge a portable implementation in C++. I turned to what I knew, ANSI-C, and I was perfectly able to do what I had to. I have shown this to a number of people in courses and workshops and others have used the methods to get their jobs done. It would have stopped there as my footnote to a fad, if Brian Kernighan and my publishers, Hans-Joachim Niclas and John Wait, had not encouraged me to publish the notes (and in due course to reinvent it all once more). My thanks go to them and to all those who helped with and suffered through the evolution of this book. Last not least I thank my family — and no, object-orientation will not replace sliced bread.
